==================================

This tool is created to make retrieving data from http ``response.json()`` or json library ``json.loads()`` easy.
It helps to ``flatten``, ``filter``, ``select``, ``update``, and ``sort`` such objects, finally ``to_df`` (depends on `Pandas`_).

.. _Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org
